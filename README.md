# Kiwi.com-_Python-v-kend_-task-
Task for a python challenge organized by KIWI.com


Simple command line application for flight booking simulation using kiwi.com APIs.

Execute with "--help" flag to display program options and their usage.

In order to start   "book_flight.py"   its necesery to use modules  'flights.py',  'places.py'   and   'inputs.py'.


UPDATE:
The facts, that KIWI.com APIs depreciated and also KIWI.com booking_challenge has ended and thus also booking server cannot be accessed and used anymore(gook_flight.py) by this program mean that it serves the original purpose no more.
Nevertheless, I've decided to keep this code alive and I also kept former lines and marked them as comments (#).

The program will display only price of the flight, number of the stops between the takeoff and the landing, and will also provide user with a link to the webpage on which he is enabled to book a given flight.
